        <h2>What's the Big O?</h2>
        <p>
          The Big O notation of this sort algorithm is O(n<sup>2</sup>), because the runtime is relative to the input on the order of the square of the size of the input.

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          The insertion sort algorithm takes each list item (numbers in an array) and compares the number value to the value of the list item previous to it. If the value of the previous list item is greater than it, it will move itself before that number. The algorithm will continue with each list item, then stop running when the list is sorted from the lowest number to the highest in the array.
